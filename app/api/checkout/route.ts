/**
 * POST /api/checkout — create a Square order and charge it.
 *
 * SECURITY MODEL
 *  - Card data never reaches here. The browser tokenizes with Square's hosted
 *    iframes and sends only a single-use `sourceId`.
 *  - Prices are re-derived server-side from the catalog as it is NOW — the
 *    portal's Products list once NOMA has it switched on (lib/catalog.ts);
 *    client-sent prices are ignored entirely, and anything that cannot be
 *    priced exactly is refused.
 *  - The secret token lives only in server env.
 *
 * THE ORDERING PROBLEM — read before changing the sequence below.
 *
 * Money moves at exactly one step (D). Everything before it is reversible;
 * nothing after it is. The order is therefore:
 *
 *   A. resolve + re-price the cart      (no side effects)
 *   B. create the Square Order          (Square now holds what to ship)
 *   C. report PENDING to NGF            (fire-and-forget alarm marker)
 *   D. create the Payment               ← MONEY MOVES HERE
 *   E. report PAID / FAILED to NGF      (best-effort)
 *   F. respond success                  (decided at D, never at E)
 *
 * Why C exists: if E were the only report and E failed, no row would exist and
 * nothing would announce that fact. With C, a PENDING row appears the moment
 * the buyer commits — so any PENDING order older than ~15 minutes is a
 * self-announcing alarm that something may have been charged and never
 * confirmed. It costs one fire-and-forget call.
 *
 * RULES THAT MUST NOT BE BROKEN:
 *  1. Never fail the response to the buyer after D succeeded. Once the payment
 *     is COMPLETED the answer is success, whatever NGF or logging did. Anything
 *     else invites them to pay twice.
 *  2. Never void or refund a settled payment because a downstream write failed.
 *     Refunds are a human decision in the Square Dashboard.
 *  3. Never treat a network failure at D as "not charged" — see the ladder below.
